# GitHub PR Response

Hi @Zachatoo,

Thank you for catching that! I've now fixed the "Select Folder" text to use sentence case as "Select folder" in `/src/ui/modals/folder-suggest-modal.ts:18`.

## ✅ All Feedback Items Addressed (Including Latest)

### Code Quality & Standards
1. ✅ **Removed empty `fundingUrl`** from manifest.json
2. ✅ **Removed `main.js`** from repository (now in .gitignore)
3. ✅ **Removed ALL console statements** - No console.log, console.error, or console.warn in production code
4. ✅ **Removed unused `lang` folder** - Now using built-in translations only

### UI Improvements
5. ✅ **Applied sentence case** throughout all UI text (including "Select folder" - just fixed)
6. ✅ **Removed top-level headings** in settings tab
7. ✅ **Used `setHeading()`** for section headings instead of H2/H3 elements
8. ✅ **Removed "configuration"** from settings headings (now just "AI" instead of "AI configuration")

### API Usage
9. ✅ **Using `normalizePath()`** for all user-defined folder paths
10. ✅ **Using `getLanguage()`** API to detect Obsidian's language setting
11. ✅ **Using `MetadataCache.getFileCache()`** for efficient file metadata retrieval
12. ✅ **Using `Vault.getAllFolders()`** to get vault folder list

### Code Improvements
13. ✅ **Removed language change listener** - Not needed as Obsidian requires restart
14. ✅ **Removed unused translation file loading code** 
15. ✅ **Implemented conditional command** - AI fix layout only available with active markdown file
16. ✅ **Using `messageEl`** instead of deprecated `noticeEl`

## 📝 Regarding Optional Feedback

### About Naver's API
Unfortunately, Naver's official API doesn't provide access to full blog post content - it only offers basic search functionality with limited metadata. To achieve the plugin's core functionality (extracting complete posts with formatting and images), HTML parsing is the only viable approach.

### About AbstractInputSuggest
The current custom folder dropdown implementation works well with type-ahead support. I can switch to AbstractInputSuggest if specifically required, but the current implementation provides a good user experience.

## 🔄 Ready for Re-review

All requested changes have been implemented and tested, including the latest fix for sentence case. The plugin now fully complies with Obsidian's plugin guidelines:
- No console output in production
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper use of Obsidian APIs
- User-friendly interface with proper sentence case throughout

The plugin is ready for your re-review. Thank you for your patience and detailed feedback!

Best regards,
