# GitHub Issue Response

Hi @Zachatoo,

Thank you for the thorough review! I've addressed all the issues you mentioned:

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
1. **Removed empty fundingUrl** from manifest.json
2. **Updated all UI text to sentence case** - Applied throughout en.json 
3. **Improved settings headings** - Removed top-level headings and used `setHeading()` instead
4. **Added main.js to .gitignore** 
5. **Using `normalizePath()`** for all user-defined folder paths
6. **Using `getLanguage()`** API instead of localStorage access
7. **Removed language change listener** - Not needed with proper API usage
8. **Using `MetadataCache.getFileCache()`** instead of reading all Markdown files for better performance
9. **Using `Vault.getAllFolders()`** to get vault folders
10. **Removed ALL console.log statements** - Completely removed all debug logging from all TypeScript files

### üìù About Naver API

Regarding your suggestion about using Naver's public API:

Unfortunately, **Naver's official API doesn't support fetching full blog post content**. Their API only provides:
- Basic blog search functionality
- Limited metadata (title, description snippet, link)
- No access to full post content, images, or formatting

This plugin needs to parse the actual blog post HTML to:
- Extract the complete article content with proper formatting
- Download and process embedded images
- Preserve the original post structure (lists, code blocks, etc.)

Therefore, web scraping is the only viable approach to achieve the plugin's functionality. I've implemented robust error handling and multiple fallback methods to ensure reliability.

## Next Steps

All requested changes have been implemented and tested. The plugin is now ready for re-review.

Thank you for your patience and detailed feedback!

Best regards
